Providers use a terminal with one-line display and built-in
keyboard to enter a member number. The terminal then communicates
with the ChocAn Data Center computer to verify the member number.
The provider then enters information about the service provided
and completes a provider form. A service record and the provider
form are then written to a disk. Member reports, provider reports,
and EFT data are produced weekly by the ChocAn Data Center
computer. Managers can use their computer terminals to produce
reports at any time. Operators can add, update, and delete member
records and provider records stored on the ChocAn Data Center
computers. The system communicates with the Acme computer to
update member records.

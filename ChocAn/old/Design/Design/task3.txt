Our design is composed primarily of modules which utilize informational cohesion. Each module contains multiple methods to perform different actions each with discrete entry and exit points with independent code all performed on the same data structure. This allows us to easily modify each module at a later time should we need to. The modules that are not informational, primarily print functions, are functional. This is not as good as informational as creating full modules for a single function creates extra effort, but the modules are expandable and reusable. Our design also utilizes both stamp and data coupling. Although the stamp coupling, primarily found in the print functions, creates a bit of inefficiency in the system, it is not to the extent that we would expect problems. In general, our design has high cohesion and moderately low coupling resulting in a well designed system.
